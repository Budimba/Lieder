1. Only a face at the window, OnOn ly a face, nothing more; Yet the look in the eyes, as they meet mine, Still comes to me o’er to and o’er Only a word, man, of greeting, Only a word that was all; Yet all day, in my heart it conechoed, Like the sound of an anman gel’s call.
2. Only a smile of welcome, Only a smile, as I pass’d; But that smile will still be remember’d As long as my life shall last Only a wolowyou tell me! Only a woman! to thee; But there’s naught that this mere earth the taineth, Half so dear as this woer to me.
3. Only her love I ask for, Only her love, and yet, The sweet boon I cannot hope for, And so I must strive forget Only a word ly spoken, Only a “yes” would she say; It would give the sweet face at window, To be mine forevand aye.
