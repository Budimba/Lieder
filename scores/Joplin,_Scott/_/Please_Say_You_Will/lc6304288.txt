Closed in the parlor we are alone Happy to be with one that I love I'll ask you kindly oh Mamie dove Do speak just a few words to bind us in love I will confess that I have been false The other girl was really the cause She is a flirt too, and never still I don't love none but you please say you will Must I plead must I kneel and you not forgive Has your heart love been sealed do you love me still You have always been true now why not forgive I don't love none but you please say you will
Oh Mamie loved one don't treat me so You have forsaken where will I go, Bowed on my knees I pray once again Forgive me my loved one for I am to blame Once you were kind and kissed me so sweet The other girl has fooled me complete Now I will live true why not forgive I don't love none but you please say you will
Now we must part love I'll ask again Don't let this pleading be all in vain You know I love you why not forgive For my heart is broken oh please say you will Let us agree love open your heart Don't let that flirt now keep us apart I am so humble and pleading still I don't love none but you please say you will
