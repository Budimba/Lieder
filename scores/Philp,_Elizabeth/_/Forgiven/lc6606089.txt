1. Lie, snowy flakes, upon the wold, Sorrow hath froze my heart; Cease, sobbing bells, the tale of old, Peace hath with me no part. Oh! for a voice to reach to Heav’n, And bring an angel guest, To tell me that the Past’s forgiv’n, To tell me that the Past’s forgiv’n, And whisper hopes of rest, And whisper hopes of rest.
2. I know dow to trust Love my all in all, The solemn the pledge I broke, And words that I would fain recall, In jealous warmth I spoke; You, oh! my friend, my friend of years, How sorely I repeat, Ah! bridge with a smile this gulf of tears, Clash Bridge with a smile the gulf of tears, And let me die content And let me die content.
3. A shathwart path doth fall, My cry cloud hath riv’n, O looks of love that tell me all, At last I stand forgiv’n. Fly snowy flakes, across the wold; This heart beats warm again; Clash out, glad bells, the tale of old, out glad bells, the tale of old; “Peace, goodwill t’wards men Peace, goodwill t’wards men.”
