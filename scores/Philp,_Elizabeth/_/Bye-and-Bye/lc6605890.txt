1. Thereâ€™s a little mischief making Urchin who is ever nigh, Stopping ev'ry undertaking, And his name is "ByeandBye:" What we ought to do this minute, Will be better done, he'll cry, If tomorrow you begin it, "Put it off" says ByeandBye, "Put it off" says ByeandBye, "Put it off" says ByeandBye, ByeandBye, ByeandBye, "Put it off" says ByeandBye.
2. Those who heed his treach'rous wooing, Will his faithless guidance rue, What we always put off doing, Clearly we shall never do. We shall gain if we endeavour, And on Fairy "Now" rely, But unto the realms of "Never," Lends the Goblin ByeandBye.
