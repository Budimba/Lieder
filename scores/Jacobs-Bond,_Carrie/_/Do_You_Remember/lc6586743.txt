1. Do you remember the days in the mountains? Do you remember the mist on the lea? Do you remember the scent of the wildflow’rs? And are these mem’ries still mem’ries of me? Do you remember the dew on the fernleaves Down by the brook that flows on to the sea? Do you remember the songs sung together? And, thus rememb’ring, think sometimes of me? Re member, remember, Altho’ we’re apart, Thro’ silence and distance You still hold my heart. heart.
2. Do you remember the days in the mountains? Do you remember the sky’s wondrous blue? Do you remember the meadowlark’s singing? To me these memries are mem’ries of you. Do you remember the song of the cricket? And the soft moonbeams aslant on the hill? Do you remember the soft winds asighing Down thro’ the canyons so peaceful and still?
