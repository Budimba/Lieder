When the harvest all was gathered In the sunny Autumn weather, To the greenwood, blithe and merry, We went nutting all together; And as the woods we wander’d, So dim and dark and green, We heard a sweet voice calling Though noone could be seen: “Two sticks across, And a little bit of moss; It’ll do, it’ll do, it’ll do, Coo, coo, coo.” The wild things of the woodlands Scarce seemed of us afraid; The blue jay flash’d before us, And the Squirrel near us played. We ate our nuts and rested On a fallen tree, mossgrown, And still a voice kept calling In softest, tend’rest tone: “Two sticks across, And a little bit of moss; It’ll do, it’ll do, it’ll do, Coo, coo, coo.”
