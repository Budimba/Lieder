Lord, for tomorrow and its needs, I do not pray; Keep me, my God, from stain of sin, Just for today; Let me no wrong or idle word Unthinking say; Set thou a seal upon my lips, Just for today; In pain and sorrowâ€™s cleansing fires, Brief be my stay; Oh, bid me if today I die, Come home today; So for tomorrow and its needs, I do not pray, But keep me, guide me, love me, Lord; Just for today.
Let me both diligently work, And duly pray; Let me be kind in word and deed, Just for today; Let me in season, Lord, be grave, In season gay; Let me be faithful to thy grace, Just for today. (Oh, take me in thy loving arms Lest I should stray)
