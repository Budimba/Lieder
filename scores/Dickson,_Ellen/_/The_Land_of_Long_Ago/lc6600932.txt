Do you ask me, little people, Where I find my songs and ditties? Oh, it’s far from tow’r and steeple, Far from fields, and far from cities; Ay, so very far that never, Though your feet were like the wind, Could you reach the place for ever Out of sight, and out of mind Wait, my children, time will show it, Through the gloom of years ’twill grow, Clear to all your eyes–– You’ll know it As the land of Long ago. 2. You may laugh, my little people, But be sure my story’s true, For I vow, by yon church steeple, I was once a child like you; Just as frisky in the wildwood, Just as nimble in the race; But I lost my happy childhood; Do you ask in what strange place, In what darksome lanes and alleys, It slipp’d from me? you shall know; It was in the dewy valleys Of the Land of Long a– go.
3. Now the portal closes, closes, And the darkness walls it round, Leaving childhood by the roses, Age upon the flinty ground: Nay, my children, not in sadness, Nor reproach, these words I say; God is good, and gives new gladness, When the old He takes away But where all my songs and ditties I go seeking, now you know; Far from fields, and far from cities, In the Land of Long a– go.
