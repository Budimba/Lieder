Ask me no more: The moon may draw the sea, The cloud may stoop from heav’n and take the shape, With fold to fold, of mountain or of cape: But O too fond, When have I answer’d thee? Ask me no more. Ask me no more: What answer should I give? I love not hollow cheek or faded eye: Yet, O my friend, I would not have thee die! Ask me no more, lest I should bid thee live: Ask me no more. Ask me no more! thy fate and mine are seal’d: I strove against the stream and all in vain. Let the great river take unto the main: No more, no more, dear love, for at a touch I yield. Ask me no more.
