Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean, Tears from the depth of some divine despair Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes, In looking on the happy Autumn fields, And thinking of the days that are no more. Fresh as the first beam glitt’ring on a sail, That brings our friends up from the underworld, Sad as the last which reddens over one That sinks with all we love below the verge; So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more. Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns The earliest pipe of halfawaken’d birds To dying ears, when unto dying eyes The casement slowly grows a glimm’ring square. So sad, so strange, The days that are no more. Dear as remember’d kisses after death, And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feign’d on lips that are for others; deep as love, Deep as first love, and wild, wild with all regret; O Death in life, The days that are no more.
