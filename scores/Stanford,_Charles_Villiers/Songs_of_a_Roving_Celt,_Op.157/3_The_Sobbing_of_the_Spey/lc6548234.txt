1. ’Tis the sobbing of the Spey, Like the weary voice acrying Of a mother, lone and grey, For her lost own ones roevmantic er sighing; And where skies of sapphire glisten In the lands beyond the main, There are straining ears that listen As the voice goes out again “Bring me back my sons and daughters, Children of a vanished day; For the sorrows haunt the waters In the sobbing of the Spey.”
2. Oh! the children of her fame Who return to tell her never That their love is still the same For their river; From the bonds of wealth caressing, ’Mid the wastelands and the green, How they fain would seek a blessing From the regal Moutain Queen But the spirit of the waters Still is calling “Come away;” And there’s grief for sons and daughters In the sobbing of the Spey.

3. There’s a crying in the night Like a note of sadness straying; Is there ear can hear aright What the wafted voice is saying? Few there be who know, but rather Turn them to the worldly thrall; Yet wherever Scotsmen gather They can hear that homeland call. Saying ever, saying ever “Sons and daughters, why thus faithless do ye stray, While the sorrows haunt the waters In the sobbing of the Spey?”
