1. Forever thine! whate’er this heart betide; Forev er thine, where’er our lots he cast; When Fate, that may rob us of all wealth beside, Shall leave us love, till life itself be past. The world may I wrong us, we will brave its hate, False friends the may change, iance and false hopes decline, Tho’ bowed by cank’ring care, we’ll smile at fate, Since thou art mine, beloved, and I am thine! Forever thine! Forev er thine!
2. Forever thine! when circling years have spread, Time’s snow y blossoms o’er thy pallid brow, When youth’s rich est glow, its purple light is fled, And li lies bloom where roses flourish now. ForSay, shall love the fading beauty less, Whose springtide radles has been wholly mine? No! come what will, thy steadfast truth I’ll bless, In youth, in age, thine own, forever thine! Forveer thine! Forev er thine!
3. Forever thine! at evening’s dewy hour, When gen tle hearts to tend’rest tho’ts incline, balmiodors from each closing flow’r, Are breathing round me, thine, forever thine! ever thine! amid the boisterous crowd, When jest sparkwith the sparkkling wine, I may not speak thy gentle name aloud, But pledge to thee in thought, forever thine! Forever thine! Forev er thine!
