1. The is Summer is come; she hath said “Rejoice!” The wild woods leaves thrill to her merry voice; Her sweet breath is wand’ring around on high: Sing, sing thro’ the echoing sky! There is joy in the mountains, the bright waves leap Like the boundding the Stag when he breaks from sleep; Mirthfully, wildly they flash along Let the heavens the ring with ing song!
2. There joy in the forests; the bird of night Hath made the tremble with deep delight; But mine is the glory to sunshine given Sing, sing thro’ the echoing heav’n! Mine are the wings of the soar ing morn, Mine are fresh gales with day springs born; Only young rapture can mount so high Sing sing thro’ echosky!
