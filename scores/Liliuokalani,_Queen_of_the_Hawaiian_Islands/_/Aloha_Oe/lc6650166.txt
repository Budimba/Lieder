Haaheo ka ua inā pali Ke nihi aela kanahele E hahai ana ika liko Pua āhihi lehuao uka
Proudly swept the rain cloud by the cliffs As on it glided through the trees Still following with grief the liko The āhihi lehua of the vale
Aloha oe aloha oe E ke onaona noho ika lipo A fond embrace, a hoi ae au Until we meet again.
Farewell to thee farewell to thee Thou charming one who dwells among the bowers One fond embrace, before I now depart Until we meet again
