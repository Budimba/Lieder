1. Where is now the merry party, I remember long ago, Laughing round the Christmas fire, ters Brighten’d by its ruddy glow. Or in summer’s balmy ev’nings, In the field upon the hay, They have all dispers’d and wander’d Far away, far away, They have all dis pers’d and wander’d Far away, far away.
2. Some have gone to lands far distant And with strangers made their home; Some up– on the world of wahere, All their lives are forc’d to roam. Some have gone from us for ever, Longer here they might not stay, They have reach’d a fairer region, Far away, far away, They have reach’d a fairer region Far away, far away.
3. There are still some few remaining Who remind us of the past; But they change as all things change Nothing in this world can last. Years roll on, and pass for ever, What is coming, who can say? Ere this closes many may be Far away, far away, Ere this closes, many may be Far away, far away.
